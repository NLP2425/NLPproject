# Steps for Preparing Review Data

## Step 1: Data Collection
- Reviews were extracted from selected sources while ensuring that they are in Croatian.

## Step 2: Filtering and Cleaning
- Special attention was given to removing metadata such as unnecessary links, movie descriptions (e.g., duration, genre, or synopsis), and author information from review articles.
- Ensured that each review was complete and that the extracted sentences were grammatically intact.

## Step 3: Formatting
- The data was structured in both **tab-separated values (TSV)** and **comma-separated values (CSV)** formats.
